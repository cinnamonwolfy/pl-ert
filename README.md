# PortaLinux Embedded Runtime

The PortaLinux Embedded Runtime, or PL-ERT, is an implementation of ESB 1.1's
API (most POSIX calls and all pl32lib-ng/PortaLinux Runtime calls) that does
not depend on the Standard C library. This library only supports static linking
and will only link "properly" (no warnings) with a freestanding C compiler

# Build instructions

Currently, there is no build system. One is currently in the works and will be
released later on.

# Contributions

Due to this being freestanding pl32lib-ng, it inherits its contribution clause,
which means that contributions will never be accepted. I, Sophie, will be the
only contributor to this project throughout its entire life.
